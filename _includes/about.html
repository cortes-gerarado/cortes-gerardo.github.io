                  I worked with Gerardo on several different projects at Backcountry, his skills to deliver high-quality software allowed us to put into production solutions that in other occasions would have been impactful to the business and our customers, he thinks in stability, performance, security, and incremental rollouts. He was able to do so by technically leading the ERP go-live for the Company in regards to Product Data and Purchase orders, these integrations had zero impact on the overall put into production. Additionally, Gerardo led the design and architecture of a new Email Service Provider for the company, he engaged with stakeholders, worked on yet another seamless deployment and was the go-to person for both stakeholders and engineers, he is a person that rapidly engages and understands the technical and functional needs, he builds software that delivers value as soon as possible and then iterates on it to guarantee the quality is there for the long term, running chaos testing, load testing and always looking for design and stability patterns to be present.

                  Gerardo and I worked together in the Marketing, Merchandise & Content Software Team from November 2016 until April 2020. In that time Gerardo emerged into a strong leader who greatly influenced the improved quality of our code and processes. This was illustrated by his constructive feedback in code reviews, his mentorship of newer team members, and his self-started project to standardize logging, metrics, and dashboards across a number of our systems. His project, dubbed ‘Logging & Monitoring’ was critical for our team during high-demand times (such as Black Friday) and enabled us to quickly identify and resolve issues before such impacts became devastating.

                <p>
                  In addition to his technical capabilities, I must highlight Gerardo’s exceptional character and reliability. He was a teammate that could always be counted on, evident by the many long, stressful nights and projects and war rooms in which he participated. He was always in the trenches, ready to jump into the fire, not just because he felt responsible for the systems but also because he felt responsible for the health and morale of his team.

                <p>I worked with Gerardo for more than 3 years at Backcountry.com. During that period, I saw him grow as a professional who is constantly striving for the highest quality in everything he does. Gerardo is a proficient Software Developer, expert in Java, Javascript and other full-stack technologies. He has SME-level knowledge in Enterprise Architecture and Agile methodologies. He is also a great team player who can always be trusted. Not only will he do what is needed to get things done but he will take as much time as needed to mentor and guide his peers when he is asked for help. Even when that might mean staying after hours or having to catch up later. Gerardo was always focused on customer satisfaction and lead our team towards building a high-performance culture where everyone could be themselves while focusing on being productive.</p>
                <p>Gerardo possesses a combination of solid tech skills and great leadership and people skills. He pays a lot of attention to detail, provides excellent technical reviews on software designs and implementation, always evaluates the non-functional aspects of software solutions and constantly pushes their peers to do better. He is a great guy and I can say that I thoroughly appreciated working with him at Backcountry and would be happy to work with him again in the future.</p>
